CouchDB is an open source database developed by Apache software foundation. It is a NoSQL document store database.It uses JSON, to store data (documents), java script as its query language to transform the documents.

Advantages:

- As we store data in the flexible document-based structure, there is no need to worry about the structure of the data.
